# TgM Downloads
Simple Extension that gives you the possibility to show downloads filtered by TYPO3 categories. Supports DataTables and Pagination

## Description 
You can create new download entrys (one entry, one download). 
One entry has:
* Title
* Date
* The download file (FAL)
* TYPO3 categories

After the creation of new downloads, you need to setup the TgM Download plugin, on the page where the downloads should be shown.
And VoilÃ , you will see the downloads on your website.

Inside the plugin you can choose between the normal TYPO3 pagination or DataTables (https://datatables.net/).
Here you can also set the categories that you wanna display.

## Features 
* Pagination

* Filter: You can use TYPO3 categories for your downloads and so control your output, thanks filter settings inside the plugin.
* Faceted Search (alias ke_search  version > 2.4.1) indexer out of the box

## TODO
* Translate the flexform labels properly (Plugin settings)
